I have been blogging since I was 15 and I have used platform such as Blogger, Wordpress and even tried Medium. I have decided to switch to using Github Pages to host my official site and blog. It will probably take some time before I migrate everything I have from the above mentioned sites (except Blogger).

So, check back often and you will see the site come alive with more content.
