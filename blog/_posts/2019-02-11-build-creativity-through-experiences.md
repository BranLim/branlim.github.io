It's very easy for us humans to fall into the trap of sticking to what's familiar. We like it because of how it makes us feel. Comfortable is the word to use here. After all, who likes to struggle every day of their life?

I definitely don't. But I recognised that it had crept up on me. I grew comfortable with what I'm doing with my life that my blog is suffering from lack of content. Comfort leads to writer's block and that leads to no content created.

So being comfortable is bad.

Right?

Probably...

By allowing yourself to grow very comfortable and remain status quo, it's very easy for you to find you are unable to think out of the box or come up with new solutions fast enough. It's just a fact. Similar to how you keep doing the same set of exercises and your body has grown used to it, comfort leads to strengthening of existing neural connections that you have already established, and after a while the brain stops doing that because there's no more necessary changes to the signalling.

Don't get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with being comfortable. Comfortable sometimes could be you have reached the pinnacle of whatever skill you are developing. That means you could do that thing faster than before.

However, the key here is moderation.

New challenges and experiences forces the brain to create new connections and reshape existing ones. And when you keep doing that, the brain is constantly changing and reinforcing certain connections that ultimately results in its ability to come up with new ideas. This is where you can think out of the box when the time comes. If you keep practicing doing that, it can also make you more confident as a person when it comes to dealing with new problems as they come.

For those who are neurotic, constantly worrying about stuff or have low self-esteem, they would probably go like, "Are you crazy? Take on new challenges? I'd rather kill myself."

I know. I can relate. It's very difficult to get yourself to experience new things. Personally, I have this issue because of my innate desire for stability and consistency in life. I've lost count of how many times I need to will myself to do something different just so that I expand my knowledge and experience.

This is why you won't see me asking someone to do something drastic just to increase or revive your creativity. For example, there is no need for you to jump out of a perfectly good airplane just so you can jumpstart your creativity. You won't see me doing that either.

Yet, it's not good either to leave the "lack of experience, can't create" situation unresolved. Not if you want to grow any further.

Instead, what you probably could do is find and know where is your comfort zone. Then ask yourself if you are willing to go out of your comfort zone by just one or two steps. If you do, then do it. And if you do manage to go out of your comfort zone by three to ten steps, then it's even better. If not, then it's better that you don't complain about your situation and just live with it.

And you know what?

Sometimes, the new experience can come from simply changing up where you stand or sit when you are riding the train to work or to go back home. Or having a drink at your local coffee shop. Or maybe just take a different route to go to your usual places.
