### Overview

I am a Software/Quality Engineer. 

I graduated with Bachelors in Engineering (Computer Science) and can work with languages such as C#, Java and Typescript/Javascript. When not writing codes, I will be doing quality assurance, process improvements and testing.

My non-work interests include the sciences, western culture and history, health, and technology. I will also be reading science-fiction novels, playing video games, watching videos, hunting for Japanese food, and/or hanging out with friends and family.

I also write both fiction and non-fiction. For fiction, I prefer to write stories in science/speculative fiction genre. For non-fiction, I write about the random thoughts and opinions that I have, tech and science news, and reviews of different sorts.
