Ominous clouds rolling across the white canvas, coming to a halt above.

Unsuspecting bipedals moved beneath, going about their lives.

A roar, a flash, an inverted tsunami follows, as though gods are crying, turning everything into slippery glisters.

Bipedals, wet as rain, run for their lives, seeking the nearest shelters, waiting for drier times.
